# How to Specify a Server:
# You might use speedtest-cli to test your serversâ€™ network capacity at some
# point. While the tool itself provides a good platform for running speed tests,
# sometimes the server selection that the tool provides can be less than
# optimal. However, you can pass the --list switch to generate a list of
# speedtest servers. Then, you can use the resulting server ID to target a
# certain speedtest server.
# The following command should show the list:
# speedtest-cli --list
# Set to False for auto best server
test_server=False

# Interval, in seconds, you want to run the updates. 3600 = 1 hour. Set interval
# to 0 if you want to the script to exit after one run.
interval=14400
